# FATBOB
A game made for Orbital 2019 

Proposed level of achievement: 
Project Gemini 

Motivation: 
During our Primary/Secondary school days, what is the first thing you typed into google? For us, it was y8.com. Inspired by games such as flappy bird, cookie run and the google chrome dinosaur game, we have decided to create a game which is similar and easily accessible to everyone. Therefore, we have decided to make this game accessible on web browsers instead of an app.  
 



Aim:
We hope to create a fun and addictive game for players.
Target Audience: 
Game players of all ages who enjoy a fast paced 2D side-scrolling game. However, our main target audience would be teenagers. This is a stress-free game designed for players to take a short break from their work. 
Game storyline:
“Time’s up, stop writing.” The teacher said. After months of studying, summer break is finally here. This is the freedom FATBOB has been longing for. Leaving everything aside, he starts running, and he is not going back anytime soon.

Welcome to FATBOB’s Crazy Summer Adventure! 
Help FATBOB escape the bustling city. 
Collect as many coins as possible, to unlock new worlds.
Avoid phones, pens, and papers, or anything that demands FATBOB’s attention. He does not want to be tied down on his adventure. Once he hits any of these obstacles, he will be sent back to work.
Say yes to various power ups, to give FATBOB the boost of energy that he needs.

Main Features: 
1.Graphics 
The game will be 2D animated. We will use a simple cityscape as the background. Character design of fatbob, powerups and obstacles will be done by us.

2.Gameplay
This will be a 2D side-scrolling gameplay. There will only be 2 buttons in this game - Jump & Slide. Players by default runs continually right and has to avoid obstacles using the 2 buttons. Power ups will be added to give player superpowers that will enhance gameplay. Different variations of power ups will be added to the game at a later timing.

3.Stamina bar
We will be adding a stamina bar to keep track of the energy level of Fatbob. As he runs, energy will be depleted. He will have to collect a health power up during the run - that will increase his energy level to maximum again. The game ends when the player hits the obstacle, or when the stamina bar runs out.


Other Features: 
1.Game statistics 
During a run, the current score (based on the number of coins the player have collected), will be displayed at the top right corner of the screen.
The game will keep a record of the player’s highscore, as well as the total number of coins the player have collected throughout the game. The coins can be used to unlock new worlds.

2. Power Ups 
Type of power ups:
Super Strength - Gives players ability to run through obstacles without being eliminated
Multiplier - Different multipliers (x2, x6) for coins for a limited duration of 10s
Energy Bars - Different increment to the stamina bar (20%)

3. Personalisation (to be added later)
Allows the player to choose between the different characters offered. For example, we have a male and a female version of FATBOB.
